- Refactor sprite's texture's stuff:
	- What needs to be done is specified in sprite.cpp
- Think about the need of a Renderer.
	- Could be good to have a class that manages everything related
		to the GPU, and if in a future some graphic effects are
		to be implemented, this class could handle them.
		Also can be beneficial when implementing GUI stuff.
- Implement Text. Let the Renderer handle it?
- Implement a scene system.
- Implement GUI elements like buttons.
